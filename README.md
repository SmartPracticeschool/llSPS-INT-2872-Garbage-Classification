Garbage Classification
The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental
pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent
waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important steps of waste management is the separation 
of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. To simplify the process, 
we propose an intelligent waste material classification system, which is developed by using the Convolutional Neural Network
model which is a machine learning tool can classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, plastic,,cardboard,trash.
